# Dino-AI: Dino Playing RL Agent
An agent trained using the principles of SPTDL using DQN RL algorithm on a CNN.
## Environment:
The environment is a custom gym environment made using the base gym environment class
Information about the observation space is obtained using MSS library as frames are given as input to the CNN
## Preprocessing:
Preprocessing is done using OpenCV library
## Algorithm (Model)
Model is obtained from Stable-Baselines3 library
### All but one libraries used are upto date (OpenAI Gym is used not Gymnasium)
